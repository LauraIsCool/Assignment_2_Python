# What the 'Assignment2' - Elsa.py program is 
The 'Assignment2-Elsa.py' file is my attempt to complete assignment 2 for course code GEOG5995. The assignment brief detailed: reading in a dataset, processing the data set in some way, displaying the results, and printing the results. 

My attempt at this assignment takes the Elsa wave 1 data set (a national dataset looking at ageing), creates a new variable for age, and selects a number of other variables to create a visualisation of the data set. This includes looking at the spread of relationship status within the population, the age distribution, and the age that people consider old, and also a breakdown of how the population consider their health to be. 

The outputs of this program are then printed either to the spreadsheet file, the pdf file or a txt file depending on the type of output generated.
